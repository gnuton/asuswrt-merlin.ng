# This is a list of regular expressions matching error messages
# from the cmwifi build which don't indicate real errors.
# NOTE: the preferred solution is always to avoid printing
# bogus error messages in the first place. Swallowing or
# modifying them is a fallback option for cases we cannot
# otherwise fix, especially in third-party code.
# If a RE contains a () capture group, only those captured
# parts will be modified unless the entire line is dropped.
