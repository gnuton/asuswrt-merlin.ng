# Fields are:
#    region-num overlay-num overlay-name ioctl1 ioctl2 name
#
# - the minimum required positional fields are region-num, overlay-num & overlay-name
# - the first symbol declared for an overlay must also include the ioctl1 & ioctl2 fields
# - subsequent symbols within a given overlay do not include the ioctl1 & ioctl2 fields
# - an iovar must also include the name field in its first symbol declaration
#
# (NOTE: the definitions in the file must be placed in numerically increasing order by 
# region-num and overlay-num, within each region. Gaps are allowed in the number sequence.)
#
# - region-num is the overlay memory region to which the overlay should be mapped
# - overlay-num is the number of the overlay within a region. multiple functions
#   and/or data (symbols) may reside in a single overlay
# - overlay-name is the symbol name of the first symbol defined for a given overlay
# - ioctl1 is the first IOCTL lookup (match) value
# - ioctl2 is the second IOCTL lookup (match) value
# - name corresponds to the iovar name lookup value
