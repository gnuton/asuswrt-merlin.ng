# It should be possible to include this file in any other makefile

# Tell make how to create the directory set specified as $1. This
# does not create any dirs itself, it simply generates rules to do
# so. Each required directory is given an order-only dependency on
# its parent recursively to ensure they'll be created on demand in
# an ordered, threadsafe way.
#
# Makefiles which use this macro should give targets an order-only
# dependency on their parent dir e.g.:
#   <target>: <prereqs>... | $$(@D)
# in order to trigger the logic generated here. This in turn requires
# that .SECONDEXPANSION be in effect which is our convention.
#
# Directory dependencies are generated both with and without a trailing
# slash for convenience, because make does lexical matching and thus
# doesn't recognize "dir" and "dir/" as the same path.
#
# Because this macro may be used in multiple places there's a risk of
# generating redundant rules to create common parent directories and
# unfortunately make gives spurious warnings in that case. Therefore
# the variable $(mkdir_rules_done) is used to cache directories which have
# already been processed. Directories are recorded internally with
# no trailing slash but filtering is done both with and without it.
# Note: this variable should logically be private but it's exposed
# (no underscore) because certain builds which are sometimes standalone
# and sometimes not, such as ucode, may want to check it.
#
# If there are directories in this hierarchy which should NOT have a
# rule generated, presumably because a custom rule is written elsewhere,
# they may be listed as exclusions in $2.
#
# Note that despite the fact that this design creates directories one
# by one in a threadsafe way it still uses mkdir -p. This is to account
# for the possibility of multiple make processes being run in parallel
# in the same checkout for different architectures, in which case they
# would not share a DAG and could still collide in creating a base dir.
# GNU mkdir has a builtin retry feature for such collisions but other

# This is a wrapper over the regular include statement. It started out as
# a pretty thin wrapper intended only to provide visual distinction from
# the word "include" which also appears in -I paths etc. but over time a
# number of other useful features have been added:
#
# 1. Visual distinction, as above.
# 2. Verbosity. A sufficient value of $V will show includes as they happen.
#    If $1 is a relative path "from $(CURDIR)" is appended to the message.
# 3. Allow a synchronous warning when the file is not found, whereas a
#    direct make include would defer the message and may never show it if an
#    $(error ...) is encountered first.
# 4. Automatic include-guarding. The include is skipped if $1 is present
#    in MAKEFILE_LIST, i.e. has already been included. Simpler and more
#    scalable than putting traditional include guards in each file.
#
# The Usage example below includes <filename> and gives a synchronous
# warning if not found; passing "error" would change the warning to an
# immediate fatal error. Passing nothing leads to default behavior in
# which no message is printed until after a recipe is found and run.
#

#   $3: may be "warning" or "error", or null.
#   $4: force re-include even if $1 has already been included.

# Declare the invoking make to be one that follows our standard/preferred
# conventions for strictness, verbosity, etc. Details:
# - A default phony goal of "all" is an industry-wide convention.
# - Our verbosity model is driven by $V and may make recipes silent by default.
#   However, this cannot be done where the Linux kernel makefile system is
#   involved because it doesn't use our system so a $1 flag is supported
#   to suppress .SILENT (note: GNU make 4.4 may fix this).
# - Strictness is cranked up with .DELETE_ON_ERROR.
# - Our convention is to have .SECONDEXPANSION on for all targets.
# - Builtin defaults are cleared out with .SUFFIXES and -r.
# - Setting SHELL (and .SHELLFLAGS) disables fast-path but it's worth it to
#   get consistent verbosity behavior and shellflag enhancements.
# - .SHELLFLAGS gets extra flags to make recipes stricter: the shell is
#   always invoked with -e (errexit) and -u (nounset) to abort on unassigned
#   shell variables. Also pipefail becomes the default so pipes don't lose
#   exit status. The -x flag is varied on a per-target basis by the
#   .vbt macro unless V=9 in which case it's always on.
# - The DEVMODE (developer mode) flag is defaulted to 1. DEVMODE affects
#   mogrification and is documented over there. It also toggles generation
#   of dependency (*.d) files.
# - Force the locale and in particular sorting to "C" during the build.
#   Can't risk having subtle variations from user to user based on
#   their personal locale settings.
# - The BRCM LSF infrastructure has a way of passing LD_LIBRARY_PATH
#   values from the submission host to the execution host which can
#   cause problems if they're different arch types. Strip LSF-added paths
#   at the start of the build.

# This macro supports the traditional gcc -MD -MF -MP flags for dependency
# generation during C compilation steps combined with a pattern adapted
# from the Linux kernel designed to trigger rebuilds on recipe changes.
# See http://make.mad-scientist.us/autodep.html and
# https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-10.4.0/gcc/Preprocessor-Options.html
# for details on the former and a modern Linux kernel tree for the latter.
#
# HOW IT WORKS:
#
# The make code below looks very weird, like monkeys-on-typewriters weird,
# but it makes sense when you go through it in detail.
#
# First, the special target .SECONDEXPANSION is enabled with scope from
# where it's given to the end of the makefile. Second expansion allows
# escaped automatic variables to be referenced in the prerequisite list.
# We believe .SECONDEXPANSION should always be enabled.
#
# This implementation gives generated dependency files a .d extension and
# places them in a subdirectory. A rule is generated to create the deps
# dir on demand.
#
# A pattern-specific setting is used to define a variable $(recipe_c2o)
# for all "%.o: %.c" rules. Note that $(recipe_c2o) uses deferred (=)
# expansion which allows it to refer to automatic variables like $@ even
# though they aren't defined yet.
#
# Then a special phony target "RECIPE_CHANGED" is declared which will be
# used to force a rebuild when the recipe changes. Here is the main magic:
#
#     %.o: %.c $(<recipe-compare-logic>)
#
# The trick is that when the recipe hasn't changed the recipe comparison
# evaluates to null so this becomes just a "%.o: %.c" pattern rule, but if
# the recipe HAS changed it evaluates to "RECIPE_CHANGED". Since that's a
# phony target it's always considered out of date and thus causes the .o
# file which depends on it to be rebuilt.
#
# Now comes the recipe. The first line is $(recipe_c2o) which expands
# to the compile command. Remember this must be defined with deferred
# expansion so its references to automatic variables are only expanded
# when they have values.
#
# The special gcc -M* flags are inserted into $(recipe_c2o) to write
# prereq aka dependency data into a separate file which is assigned to $@.d,
# e.g. "foo.o.d". The last line of the recipe knows the $@.d file has
# already been made so it can append a variable assignment to it. The value
# assigned is essentially the recipe with certain special characters
# replaced by a caret (^).
#
# Finally, "-include" is used to read the *.d files if they exist. Since
# they're created by the same recipe that makes the .o files they should
# exist IFF their corresponding .o file exists.
#
# Summary: a given .o file will either exist or not. If it does there
# should also be a .d file listing its prerequisites. If the .o doesn't
# exist it will obviously need to be built no matter what. And if somehow
# the .o exists and the .d doesn't the recipe comparison would fail
# forcing a rebuild. All updates of the .o must also update the .d.
#
# The .DELETE_ON_ERROR special target is used to ensure that a corrupted
# foo.o and foo.o.d combination can never break the build. Make will delete
# only foo.o on recipe failure since it doesn't even know about foo.o.d
# (which is called a "sibling" target). But since foo.o will be deleted
# automatically on failure, foo.o.d cannot cause bad build decisions even
# if left around since the named target foo.o must be rebuilt on the next
# pass even if the dependency data in foo.o.d is bad, and when that happens
# foo.o.d will be regenerated too.

# Private support macro, not used directly. See callers for parameters.
