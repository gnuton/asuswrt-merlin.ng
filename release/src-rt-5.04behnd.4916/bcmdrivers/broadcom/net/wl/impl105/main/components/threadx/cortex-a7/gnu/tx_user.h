/* Define various build options for the ThreadX port.  The application should either make changes
   here by commenting or un-commenting the conditional compilation defined OR supply the defines 
   though the compiler's equivalent of the -D option.  
   
   For maximum speed, the following should be defined:

        TX_MAX_PRIORITIES                       32  
        TX_DISABLE_PREEMPTION_THRESHOLD
        TX_DISABLE_REDUNDANT_CLEARING
        TX_DISABLE_NOTIFY_CALLBACKS
        TX_NOT_INTERRUPTABLE
        TX_TIMER_PROCESS_IN_ISR
        TX_REACTIVATE_INLINE
        TX_DISABLE_STACK_FILLING
        TX_INLINE_THREAD_RESUME_SUSPEND
   
   For minimum size, the following should be defined:
   
        TX_MAX_PRIORITIES                       32  
        TX_DISABLE_PREEMPTION_THRESHOLD
        TX_DISABLE_REDUNDANT_CLEARING
        TX_DISABLE_NOTIFY_CALLBACKS
        TX_NOT_INTERRUPTABLE
        TX_TIMER_PROCESS_IN_ISR
   
   Of course, many of these defines reduce functionality and/or change the behavior of the
   system in ways that may not be worth the trade-off. For example, the TX_TIMER_PROCESS_IN_ISR
   results in faster and smaller code, however, it increases the amount of processing in the ISR.
   In addition, some services that are available in timers are not available from ISRs and will
   therefore return an error if this option is used. This may or may not be desirable for a 
   given application.  */
