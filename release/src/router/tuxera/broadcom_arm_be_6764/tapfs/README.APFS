--- Usage ---

Mount APFS volumes the following way:

    tapfs-u device mountpoint

Example:

    tapfs-u /dev/sda1 /mnt/apfsvol

Read-only mount APFS volumes the following way:

    tapfs-u device mountpoint -o ro

Example:

    tapfs-u /dev/sda5 /home/user/mnt -o ro

Unmount APFS volumes the following way:

    umount mountpoint

Example:

    umount /mnt/apfsvol


--- Options ---

Below is a summary of the options that tapfs-u accepts.

    -f/--foreground
    Runs the file system in the foreground, without daemonizing it (which is the
    default behaviour). This means that any error messages are printed directly
    to the console.

    -h/--help
    Displays a brief help message including version number and copyright
    information.

    -v/--verbose
    No-op option that APFS/U accepts in order to be compatible with options
    passed by mount(8).

    -V/--version
    Dumps the version number of APFS/U and exits immediately.

    -o/--options option[,...]
    The mount options. These are described in more detail below.


--- Mount Options ---

Below is a summary of the mount options that tapfs-u accepts.

	volume_id=id
	This option selects a volume in the APFS container other than the default one.

	vol_uuid=uuid
	This option selects a volume by its UUID, as shown by apfsinfo.

	vol_name=name
	This option selects a volume by its name.

	allow_other
	This option overrides the security measure restricting file access to the
	user mounting the filesystem. This option is only	allowed to root, but
	this restriction can be overridden by the 'user_allow_other' option in the
	/etc/fuse.conf file.

	max_read=value
	With this option the maximum size of read operations can be set. The default
	is infinite. Note that the size of read requests is limited anyway to 32
	pages (which is 128 KiB on i386).

	no_def_opts
	By default tapfs-u acts as if "allow_other" (allow any user to access files)
	"default_permissions" (uid/gid/mode permission checks enabled) and
	"nonempty" (allow mounting on non-empty	directories) were set.
	"no_def_opts" cancels these default options.

	big_writes
	This option prevents fuse from splitting write buffers into 4K chunks,
	enabling big write buffers to be transferred from the application in a
	single step (up to some system limit, generally 128 KiB).
	(Only available in FUSE 2.8 and higher)

	debug
	Makes tapfs-u to print a lot of debug output from libfuse and libapfs (if
	compiled with debug messages enabled).
